# Solar System

Solar System is a demo of a solar system made from Unity3d. It was a representation of the solar system where we tweaked with the velocity, rotation, revolution and much more to get a realistic demo of what would happen if we changed their parameters. It was a worthful demo to be played with which gave us insight about out solar system. This project is intended strictly for educational purposes, initially developed for the Coursera specialization game development program. It was initially shown on 2016.
